    "# Hi!\n",
    "##### A little bit of context: I was asked if it was possible to get Google Trend's \"interest\" values for different companies across a period of time. While googling for a way to do this, I came across the \"pytrends\" library (https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/) which allows you to pull data from Google Trends using Python, with certain conditions of course. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### A main limitation in our task at hand, was that the list of keywords meant to look for on Google Trends was too big, as you can only provide 5 keywords per search. Not only this, the \"interest scores\" provided are regularized values in the context of the keywords that you provide, ranging from 0 to 100. This means that the resulting score for a particular keyword -could- vary according to the different combination of keywords provided. Therefore, a main osbtacle was finding a workaround for a list of hundreds of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Through several trial and errors trying to understand how the different results could vary, I noticed that we could achieve a certain degree of consistency if we searched for a term that had relatively high scores, as it would serve as a \"reference\" in the scaling of the other scores for the remaining terms, kind of like an anchor. In our particular case (based on my trial and errors) I noticed that a term that was giving consistent scores for the other terms in the keyword list was \"Facebook\", so I decided to have it consistently in my keywords list as the \"score anchor\". The remaining challenge was to loop the keywords and assemble a hierarchy of companies based on their average interest score. The following code aims to solve this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Please keep in mind that we can only make a certain amount of requests continously with pytrends, as with an excessive amount we would start looking like a bot and get temporarily blocked with a \"429 error\". So if your list contains a lot of elements as well, it is likely that you may want to split your data, or break the process in different steps on different occassions.  "
